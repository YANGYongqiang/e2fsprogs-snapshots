.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chsnap
changes the snapshot file attributes on a Linux fourth extended file system.
.PP
The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[Sn].
.PP
The operator `+' causes the selected attributes to be added to the
existing attributes of the files; `-' causes them to be removed; and
`=' causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.
.PP
The letters `Sn' select the new attributes for the files:
on snapshot list (S) and mount access enabled (n).
.PP
The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by
.BR lssnap (1)
but not modified by chsnap:
active (a), in use by previous snapshot (p), request to be removed from the
list (s), shrunk (h), open for read (o) and tagged (t).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-R
Recursively change attributes of snapshot directories and their contents.
.TP
.B \-V
Be verbose with chsnap's output and print the program version.
.TP
.B \-f
Suppress most error messages.
.TP
.BI \-v " version"
Set the snapshot file's version/generation number.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
A snapshot file with the 'S' attribute set is on the snapshot list.
Setting the attribute on a new snapshot file means requesting to add it
to the head of the list (i.e. snapshot take).
Resetting the attribute on a snapshot file means requesting to remove it
from the list (i.e. snapshot delete).
.PP
A snapshot file with the 'n' attribute set can be mounted via a loop device.
The snapshot file's size is the size of the snapshot'ed file system.
.PP
The 'a' attribute indicates the active snapshot, which is the last snapshot
taken.
.PP
The 'p' attribute indicates that the snapshot file is in use by a previous
snapshot, which means that an older snapshot is enabled for mount.
.PP
The 's' attribute indicates that the snapshot was deleted.  It may not have
been removed from the list yet, but it cannot be mounted anymore and it will
be removed from the list as soon as no older snapshots depend on it.
.PP
The 'h' attribute indicates that the snapshot was deleted and shrunk.
Shrinking a snapshot file means freeing blocks, which are not referenced
by older snapshots.
.PP
The 'o' attribute indicates that the snapshot is open for read, mostly used
as indication that the snapshot is mounted via a loop device.
.PP
The 't' attribute indicates that the snapshot is tagged.  This attribute is
reserved for future use and has no special meaning at the moment.

.SH BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The snapshot file attributes can only be set on snapshot files, which are
files created inside a snapshots directory.
A snapshots directory is indicated by setting the 'x' flag via
.BR chattr (1).
Snapshot file are only supported by the ext4 filesystem when the experimental
snapshot support feature is enabled.
